# Project #2 - Shopping List App

## Congratulations!

Congratulations on reaching this phase of the course! Over the next few days, you will be working on the second project that will allow you to further apply your knowledge and skills to build another real-world application. This exam project will serve as a demonstration of your proficiency in Global Data Management, focusing on understanding Flutter's architecture, project structure, widgets, global data management, and data manipulation concepts.

## Description

Your task is to create a Flutter app that demonstrates global data management for a shopping list. The app should allow users to add, view, update, and remove items from their shopping lists. Global data management should be used to efficiently store and manage the shopping list items.

## Rules & Guidelines

1. **Individual Work:** Each student is expected to work individually on their exam. Collaboration is not allowed, and each student should submit their unique work.
2. **Version Control (Git):**
   - Create a Fork from the exam’s GitHub repository.
   - Create a new branch with your name, i.e., Nawaf-Alshawan.
   - Commit frequently with descriptive messages to show your progress.
   - Finally, create a Pull Request to the exam’s original repository containing your solution.
3. **Academic Integrity:** Do not copy or reuse code from previous modules or external sources. The exam is a showcase of your learning progress.
4. **Learning References:** You may refer to course materials and code examples as learning references, but implement your solutions independently.
5. **Instructor Support:** The instructor will be available for general questions and guidance throughout the exam.

## Schedule & Deadlines

- **Exam Start Date:** 17/8/2023 - 3:00 PM
- **Exam Submission Deadline:** 20/8/2023 – 11:59 PM

## Minimum Requirements

Your task is to create a Flutter app that demonstrates global data management for a shopping list. The app should allow users to add, view, update, and remove items from their shopping lists. Global data management should be used to efficiently store and manage the shopping list items. Please note the following:

- **Correct Structure:** Ensure that the application is built with the appropriate structure. Follow Flutter's best practices for organizing code and project files.
- **Clean Code:** Write code that is clear, well-organized, and scalable. Use meaningful variable and function names and follow standard coding conventions to improve code readability.
- **Applying Concepts:** Make proper use of programming concepts and techniques. Implement efficient algorithms and follow Flutter's design patterns to create a robust and functional shopping list app.
- **Global Variable Management:** Implement global variable management techniques to efficiently store and manage the shopping list items. Create a global List variable that holds the shopping list items, and use this variable to maintain the state of the items throughout the app.
- **Data Representation:** Treat shopping list items as objects using a model. Create a model class to define the structure of a shopping list item, including attributes like name, quantity, etc.
- **User Interactions:** Users should be able to perform the following actions:
  - Add: Add new items to their shopping list along with relevant details like name, quantity, etc.
  - View: Display the list of items in the shopping list with their details.
  - Update: Allow users to modify the details of any item in the shopping list.
  - Remove: Enable users to delete items from the shopping list.
- **Utilizing Packages:** It is required that you use at least eight packages from _pub.dev_.
